Threeo.one ("Three-Oh-one") is an open-sourced URL shortening server/client written in Go. Similar to TinyURL or Bit.ly, Threeo.one can take very large urls and condense them into easily manageable, bite-sized, and aesthetic short-links of the form: `https://threeo.one/to/<id>`. The name derives from the http status code `301` which redirects traffic to another site.
